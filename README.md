# Rebase Training Repo

This Git repository give you an example where you can train/experiment with Git's rebasing feature.

You can train two things here:

1. Rebase branch `rebase/feature/multiply` onto `rebase/master`.
1. Rebase and squash branch `rebase/feature/multiply` onto `rebase/master` (using interactive rebasing).

In both cases, there will (should) be a merge conflict that you need to resolve.
